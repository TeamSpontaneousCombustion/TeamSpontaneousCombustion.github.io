desc: "The new state-of-the-art Palette Pistol is in its testing stage, and there’s one major problem. The button used to easily change the type of weapon used is stuck, thus forcing the gun to change its type automatically! Not being one to back away from a challenge, you take to the testing arenas to show that even when your weapons are stuck in a loop, your skills don’t have to be."
